### Memory Management
2. Make sure you're closing all file descriptors in `excuting_redirs.c` when errors occur.

### Signal Handling
1. There's a `struct sigaction sa` declaration in `xminishell.c` but it doesn't appear to be used.
2. Your minishell should handle signals properly (CTRL+C, CTRL+D, etc.).

### Error Handling
1. In `exec_tree.c`, some of your error handling might not be comprehensive enough, especially in complex pipelines.
2. The error messages could be more consistent across different commands.

### Built-ins
1. Your `exit` command in `exit.c` has a hardcoded exit code (5222) which isn't standard behavior.
2. The `cd` command in `cd.c` is quite basic and doesn't handle edge cases like `cd -` or update `PWD/OLDPWD` environment variables.

### Other Issues
1. There are duplicate implementations of some functions like `ft_isalpha` and `ft_isalnum` in different files.
2. The term_control.c file is commented out, suggesting terminal control functionality isn't implemented.
3. Heredoc handling might leak file descriptors if used extensively.
4. Variable expansion might need more thorough testing for edge cases.

Overall, your minishell looks solid for passing tests, but addressing these issues would make it more robust and reliable for real-world use.
